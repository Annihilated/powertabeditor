This folder contains unit tests, using the Boost Test library
(http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf.html)

Installation:
    - Install boost as described in the source/README file
    - The Boost.Test library is not header-only, and requires a compiled library

    Linux: 
        - For Ubuntu, install libboost-test-dev
        - other distributions should have a similar package

    Windows:
        - TODO

TODO - compile the powertabdocument classes as a separate library so that
we don't need to recompile everything for running the tests
