BUILDING:
- Download and install the Qt SDK for your platform (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads, choose the LGPL-licensed version)
	- this includes the QtCreator IDE and the Qt libraries and tools
- for Linux systems, ensure that ALSA libraries and headers (i.e. libasound2 and libasound2-dev) are installed
- set up the Boost libraries (http://www.boost.org/)
    - for Linux systems, install the package provided by your distribution. For Ubuntu, this will be libboost-dev
    - for Windows, install the Boost libraries to some location on your computer, either by extracting a downloaded package
      from http://www.boost.org/users/download/#releases, or using the installer from BoostPro http://www.boostpro.com/download/
        - you do not need to build any libraries, as the components of Boost that we use are header-only
        - edit the 'win32:INCLUDEPATH' line in the common.pri file to specify the location of your Boost installation
- Open the powertabeditor.pro file in QtCreator, and choose Build / Build All
- Then, either use Debug / Start Debugging, or Build / Run to run the program

NOTES:
- the 'PowerTabDocument' code was ported from Brad Larsen's PtParser (http://code.google.com/p/ptparser/)
	- it could probably use some cleanup, but that's not too high a priority
- the project builds without any warnings / errors on Windows and Linux with QtCreator
