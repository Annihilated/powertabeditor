BUILDING:
- Download and install the Qt SDK for your platform (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads, choose the LGPL-licensed version)
	- this includes the QtCreator IDE and the Qt libraries and tools
- for Linux systems, ensure that ALSA libraries and headers (i.e. libasound2 and libasound2-dev) are installed
- Open the powertabeditor.pro file in QtCreator, and choose Build / Build All
- Then, either use Debug / Start Debugging, or Build / Run to run the program

NOTES:
- the 'PowerTabDocument' code was ported from Brad Larsen's PtParser (http://code.google.com/p/ptparser/)
	- it could probably use some cleanup, but that's not too high a priority
- pretty much anything that triggers undo/redo is horribly slow if run in Debug mode
	- this can be solved, but I just haven't gotten around to working on it yet (we 
need to tell the appropiate painter to redraw itself, instead of redrawing
the entire score)
- the project builds without any warnings / errors on Windows with QtCreator

TODO: 
- redraw only the required areas upon an undo/redo action
- fix up exporting of files (PowerTabOutputStream), due to some difficulties in porting the original code
- work on complete rendering support
- support more interactive editor functionality (i.e. editing notes, removing barlines, etc)
- support more features for MIDI playback (bends, vibrato, etc)
- prevent the toolbox from being collapsed
